# Tic-Tac-Toe

A simple console-only version of the popular game of Tic-Tac-Toe.

## How to play

The two players take turns in making moves. A move is made by specifying the row and then the column. The rows are numbered from 0 to 2 (from top to bottom) and the same is for columns (0 to 2 from left to right). The rules of Tic-Tac-Toe apply here. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe
